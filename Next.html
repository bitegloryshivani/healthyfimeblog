            <h3>Water Intake as per Weight</h3>
        </u>
        <p>
            If you’ve ever tried to lose weight, you’ve probably heard a lot about water and weight loss. Can drinking
            more
            water really help
            you lose weight? The short answer is yes -- and no.
            If you’re already well hydrated and getting plenty of water, getting more water into your diet probably
            won’t
            make a lot of difference.
            But if you’re going through your days a little -- or a lot -- dehydrated, as many people are, getting enough
            water could help.
            “In my experience, most people are not aware of how much they’re drinking and are not drinking enough --
            many,
            as little as half of what
            they need,” says Amanda Carlson
        </p>

                <h3>How Water Boosts Metabolism</h3>
            </u>
        </b>
        <p>“Water’s involved in every type of cellular process in your body, and when you’re dehydrated, they all run
            less
            efficiently -- and that includes your metabolism. Think of it like your car: if you have enough oil and gas,
            it
            will run more efficiently. It’s the same with your body.”
            “Your metabolism is basically a series of chemical reactions that take place in your body,” says Trent
            Nessler,
            PT, DPT, MPT, managing director of Baptist Sports Medicine in Nashville. “Staying hydrated keeps those
            chemical
            reactions moving smoothly.” Being even 1% dehydrated can cause a significant drop in metabolism.

                <h3>The Digestive Health Benefits of Water</h3>
            </u>
        </b>
        <p>“Water allows your kidneys to function properly and filter everything they need to, and allows us to
            eliminate
            effectively and not be constipated,” Melton says. “People who don’t get enough fluids in their diet tend to
            be
            constipated.”

            And that’s not all. The single biggest cause of painful kidney stones is chronic dehydration. When you don’t
            get
            enough water, calcium and other minerals build up in your urine and are harder for your body to filter out.
            They
            can form the crystals that make up kidney and urinary stones.

            Doctors who specialize in pediatric kidney problems report seeing more kidney stones in children in recent
            years, and they believe it’s because of a combination of factors. Many kids aren’t drinking enough water.
            Also,
            many kids are overweight and eat a poor diet.

                <h3>How Much Water Do You Need?</h3>
            </u>
        </b>
        <p>How can you know if you’re getting enough water to keep your metabolism cranking at peak efficiency and your
            digestive system functioning? The formula used to be “one size fits all” -- eight 8-ounce glasses of water a
            day. But that’s changed, experts say.

            “It depends on your size and weight, and also on your activity level and where you live,” Nessler says. “In
            general, you should try to drink between half an ounce and an ounce of water for each pound you weigh, every
            day.” For example, if you weigh 150 pounds, that would be 75 to 150 ounces of water a day. If you’re living
            in a
            hot climate and exercising a lot, you’d be on the higher end of that range; if you’re in a cooler climate
            and
            mostly sedentary, you’d need less.

                <h3>Hungry or Thirsty? How Water Helps a Diet</h3>
            </u>
        </b>
        <p>It’s also very difficult for the body to tell the difference between hunger and thirst. So if you’re walking
            around feeling a gnawing sense of hunger, you might just be dehydrated. Try drinking a glass of water
            instead of
            grabbing a snack.

            Research has also shown that drinking a glass of water right before a meal helps you to feel more full and
            eat
            less. “Many people do find that if they have water before a meal, it’s easier to eat more carefully,” says
            Renee
            Melton, MS, RD, LD, director of nutrition for Sensei, a developer of online and mobile weight loss and
            nutrition
            programs.

            One study, for example, found that people who drank water before meals ate an average of 75 fewer calories
            at
            each meal. That doesn’t sound like a lot -- but multiply 75 calories by 365 days a year. Even if you only
            drink
            water before dinner every day, you’d consume 27,000 fewer calories over the course of the year. That’s
            almost an
            eight-pound weight loss.

        <p>How can you build more water consumption into your day? Try these tips:

            Carry an insulated sports bottle with you and fill it up periodically.
            Keep a glass of water on your desk at work.
            Keep another glass next to your bed. Many of us wake up dehydrated first thing in the morning.
            Switch one glass of soda or cup of coffee for a glass of water.
            Drink small amounts of water throughout the day. Six glasses all at once isn’t good for you!
